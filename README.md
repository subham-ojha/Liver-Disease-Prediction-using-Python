# Liver-Disease-Prediction-using-Python

Aging is a major risk factor for most chronic diseases. As the liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate,
this review assessed the effect of aging on clinical liver disease with references to preclinical models when relevant to pathogenesis.

This model is based on Machine Learning Classification Techniques which is implemented using Python and is capable of predicting the 
Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Alkphos Alkaline Phosphotase, Sgpt Alamine Aminotransferase, Sgot Aspartate Aminotransferase, Total
Protiens, ALB	Albumin, Albumin and Globulin Ratio in Liver given the age of the individual. 


Predictions are based on a data set which contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records. The data set was
collected from north east of Andhra Pradesh, India. Selector is a class label used to divide into groups(liver patient or not). 
This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.
